Nmap Network Scanner Script - README
What This Script Does
This script automates network scanning to help you identify devices and potential security risks on your local network. Here's what it does in simple terms:

Installs Nmap if you don't already have it (the main scanning tool)

Finds your local network range automatically (like 192.168.1.0)

Scans all devices on your network to see what's connected

Checks what services are running on each device (web servers, file sharing, etc.)

Flags potential security risks like open FTP or unprotected remote access ports

Creates two report files:

A simple text file with all findings

A nicer HTML report you can view in a browser

Why Use This?
See everything connected to your network

Find devices that shouldn't be there

Identify unprotected services that hackers might target

Get recommendations for making your network more secure
